OOAD Principle
  
-Prefer composition over inheritance: More flexible, lower coupling  
  
-Program to interface rather than implementation: Easier to test, Change and replace implementation as needed  

  
S - Single Responsibility Principle  
  
O - Open/Closed Principle  
  
L - Liskov Substitution Principle  
  
I - Interface Segregation Principle  
  
D - Dependency Inversion Principle  

Benefit of SOLID principles  
- Principle dependencies management  
- Solid foundation for OOAD to build complicated design patterns  
- Result inf following codes: (Robust, Reusable, Flexible)  
- Soldi base for designin and definin design patterns  
   
   
Design Pattern example  
  
* Creational Design Patterns : Deal with how an object need to be created 
  
- Factory Method: 
Abstract Creator  
Concrete Creator  
Static Method Creator  
  
- Abstract Factory Method  
  
- Singleton  
Lazy Evaluation
Synchronized Method  
Double Checked Locking  
Eager evaluation

- Builder  
  
- Prototype  
  
* Structural Design Paterns : The objective to simplify the structure of different object paticipant - 
                              enhancing decoupling and isolation of the entire subsystem
  
- Adapter  
Object Adapter  
Class Adapter  
  
- Bridge  
   
- Facade  
- Decorator  
- Proxy  
- Composite  
- Flyweight
  
Behavioral Design Patterns : direct how behaviors can be fine-tune, made clear and robust and 
                             it also specifies how behaviors can be made incremental in nature which allows 
                             new behaviors to be implemented in the same code design whenever new behaviors needed to be added.
